<h3 align="center">SigeLAB: Backend APIs and database backup</h3>



---

<p align="center">
  This is the SigeLAB backend database backup and application programming interfaces section. Just as the main application, this APIs are still under heavy development and constantly improvement. Here you will find the main firebase firestore data backup needed during the installation process to setup a new SigeLAB instance. All the APIs found here were made for secondary functions in SigeLAB and are not required at all to build a new instance.
