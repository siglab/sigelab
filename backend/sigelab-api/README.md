<h3 align="center">SigeLAB: Universidad del Valle SABS connection API</h3>



---

<p align="center">
  This is the Univalle's inventory connection API system. This API is still under heavy development, constantly improvement and is not needed to deploy a new SigeLAB instance. This API just works for the Universidad del Valle implementation.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This interface was built using [sails.js](https://sailsjs.com/) and these instructions will let you get the Universidad del Valle inventory API system up and running to comunicate your SigeLAB instance with our internal SABS system.

This project has a specified repository structure with separated folders for each part of the code. Here you will find a typical sails project structure plus some files and folders needed in order to configurate and deploy the application on our system.

### Installing
1. Go to the root folder (sigelab-api) and execute `npm install`.
2. Configure your [sabs](./config/sabs.js) config file with your `URL_SABS_SERVICE`.
3. Execute in the root folder the command `npm run dev` and the API will be up, running and listening to **1337** port (`npm run  start` to run in production mode).

### Usage

  This API has `/inventario/buscar` as a base endpoint, so if you deploy this interface in your local machine, the endpoint to consume should be `http://localhost:1337/inventario/buscar`. To make a call and consume this endpoint you must send a `POST` request and the body should be built as follows:

  |key:| value |
  |--|--|
  |codInventario:| "inventory code" |
  | codLab | "laboratory code" |
  |nomLab:| "laboratory name" |
  |sede:| "headquarter" |
  | edificio | "building" |
  |espacio:| "space" |

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

To deploy this API in production, we recommend the [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) usage and to follow this [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-pm2-to-setup-a-node-js-production-environment-on-an-ubuntu-vps) to set up the server.
