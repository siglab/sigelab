### Usage
This guide assumes that you already have a firebase project created and firestore activated on it as your main database.

#### Backup restoration process

1. Generate your admin service account key for your firabase project from google console. To generate those keys [check this out](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and follow those steps.
2. Rename the file you got from the previous step to ```credentials.json``` and place it in the root this folder (this folder will be know just as root folder from now).
3. Modify the firebase [config](./config.js) file with the database URL given for your a web application. Your databse url config line should look something like:
    ```
    const DATABASE_URL = 'https://yourdomain.firebaseio.com';
    ```
4. Execute in the root folder the command ```npm install```.
5. Execute in the root folder the command ```node restoreBackup.js```.

#### Backup creation process

Notice: This process will replace and/or override any ```backup.json``` file existent in the root folder.

1. Follow the steps 1 to 4 of the "Backup restoration process".
2. Execute in the root folder the command ```node createBackup.js```.
