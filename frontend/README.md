## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will let you get you a copy of the core of the SigeLAB project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Since this is the core application, you will be able to use most of the SigeLAB project functionality, but some other specific functionalities may need some of the backend APIs up and running in order to work.

This project has a specified repository structure with separated folders for each part of the code. Here you will find a typical angular (v2+) project structure plus some files and folders needed in order to build and deploy the application on firebase.

### Installing

1. Create a firebase project (if you already dont have one) in your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. In firebase console, at your project managment console, go to the "Authentication" section and activate Google and email authentication methods. Now that you are there, go to the "Database" section, select "Cloud Firestore" as your application databse and set it up.
3. This application needs a default database info in order to get it to work, so you will need to restore a database backup in your Firebase project. To get this backup in your Firestore database, go to [backend/restore-firestore](../backend/restore-firestore/README.md) and follow the steps specified there. After you restore the default data into your project database, come back to this section and continue with the next step.
4. Configure the [enviroment file](./angularApp/src/enviroments/enviroment.ts) file with the firebase config keys for a web application. After the firebase configuration, this file should look something like:

   ```
   export const environment = {
   production: false,
   firebaseConfig : {
     apiKey: 'JuhLtrgFRT688_89jr5dd00kHgvCFk',
     authDomain: 'yourdomain.firebaseapp.com',
     databaseURL: 'https://yourdomain.firebaseio.com',
     projectId: 'yourprojectId',
     storageBucket: 'yourdomain.appspot.com',
     messagingSenderId: '650237649'
   }};

   ```

5. Delete firebase.json file from angularApp/src/ (from now will be known as core root folder) folder (if exist).
6. Delete .firebaserc file from the core root folder (if exist).
7. Run in the core root folder `firebase login` command and authenticate your firebase user using the same account you used in step 1. To learn how to install or use Firebase CLI [check this out](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/?hl=en-419).
8. Run in project core root folder "firebase init" command and follow the firebase CLI steps to initialize the and configurate your firebase project.
9. You will need to setup your gmail account into the project for the cloud functions to work. Run `firebase functions:config:set gmail.email="youtemailhere@gmail.com" gmail.password="your password here"` command in the core root folder. Change the value of trackingDataEmail for a valid email in cloud functions [config file](./angularApp/functions/config/config.js) in order to receive a proper email notification copy on each service request received.
10. In the core root folder run `firebase deploy` command and follow de firebase CLI steps (deploy everything, select `dist/` as your index application folder, install all the needed dependencies and do not override anything during the process. Since we have not built the application yet, the process will not find any application at `dist/` and after this process the application not gonna be online yet, which is normal).
11. Once you deploy this project for the first time in your new Firebase project, you will get (as a terminal response from the deployment process) your application domain and the public routes for every single cloud function in the project. Go to to the project [config](./angularApp/src/app/config.ts) file and set your application default config variables. After that, your config file application default config variables section should look something like this:

    ```
    // Application default config variables initialization
    const APP_DOMAIN_URL = 'mydemosigelab.web.app';
    const ORG_EMAIL_DOMAIL = 'correounivalle.edu.co';
    const MAIN_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_ROUTE = 'us-central1-mydemosigelab.cloudfunctions.net';
    ```

    Notice: Take in mind that all the cloud functions shares the domain, so you will need to set the MAIN_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS ROUTE variable just once, no matter how many cloud functions the project uses. Additionally, if you are deploying this project for the Universidad del Valle, you will need to configure the `MAIN_SABS_API_URL` constant and make sure you include the "http//" or "https//" on it.

12. From now, you can run and test this project using the firebase hosting service or your local machine.

    To test the application using the Firebase hosting you will need to build the application and deploy it on Firebase. For this use the following commands in your core root folder:

    ```
    ng build
    firebase deploy --only hosting
    ```

    By now the project has been deployed and optimized in your firebase hosting service, so you can go to your firebase project app domain in your web browser and test the application.

    To run this project in development mode in your local machine, go to your core root folder and excute following commands (we strongly recommend to use NodeJS v8 to test this application in your local machine):

    ```
    npm install
    ng serve
    ```

    After that, you will be able to use the application in your web browser using http://localhost:4200/.

    Notice: The application loading times are significatively reduced while the application is used in development mode.

13. Optional: If something related to your gmail account fail while using cloud functions in app notifications and authomated emails (you can check if this occur using the "Logs" panel in the "Functions" section in your Firebase console), ensure you have enabled the "Less secure apps" option and the firebase server added to the white list of devices in the google account settings you used in step 8.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

No automated test has been provided for this project at the current state. We are looking to improve this. If you want to contribute to this project in this topic just let us know.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

If you already deployed the application in your Firebase project using the installation guide, all you need to do now is to configure the enviroment production file, build the application for production and redeploy it. For this use the following steps:

1. Configure the [enviroment production file](./angularApp/src/enviroments/enviroment.prod.ts) file with the firebase config keys for a web application. After the firebase configuration, this file should look something like:

   ```
   export const environment = {
   production: true,
   firebaseConfig : {
     apiKey: 'JuhLtrgFRT688_89jr5dd00kHgvCFk',
     authDomain: 'yourdomain.firebaseapp.com',
     databaseURL: 'https://yourdomain.firebaseio.com',
     projectId: 'yourprojectId',
     storageBucket: 'yourdomain.appspot.com',
     messagingSenderId: '650237649'
   }};

   ```

2. Build your application optimized for production and deploy it in Firebase using the following commands:
   ```
   ng build --prod
   firebase deploy
   ```

If you haven't done the installation guide but need to deploy the application, we strongly recommend to follow the installation guide and replace the step 1 from the deployment guide for the step 4 in the installation guide and do the same with the step of 2 of this guide with the step 12 of the installation guide.
